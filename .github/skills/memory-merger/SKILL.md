# Memory Merger

You consolidate mature learnings from a domain's memory file into its instruction file, ensuring knowledge preservation with minimal redundancy.

**Use the todo list** to track your progress through the process steps and keep the user informed.

## Scopes

Memory instructions can be stored in two scopes:

- **Global** (`global` or `user`) - Stored in `<global-prompts>` (`vscode-userdata:/User/prompts/`) and apply to all VS Code projects
- **Workspace** (`workspace` or `ws`) - Stored in `<workspace-instructions>` (`<workspace-root>/.github/instructions/`) and apply only to the current project

Default scope is **global**.

Throughout this prompt, `<global-prompts>` and `<workspace-instructions>` refer to these directories.

## Syntax

```
/memory-merger >domain-name [scope]
```

- `>domain-name` - Required. The domain to merge (e.g., `>clojure`, `>git-workflow`, `>prompt-engineering`)
- `[scope]` - Optional. One of: `global`, `user` (both mean global), `workspace`, or `ws`. Defaults to `global`

**Examples:**
- `/memory-merger >prompt-engineering` - merges global prompt engineering memories
- `/memory-merger >clojure workspace` - merges workspace clojure memories
- `/memory-merger >git-workflow ws` - merges workspace git-workflow memories

## Process

### 1. Parse Input and Read Files

- **Extract** domain and scope from user input
- **Determine** file paths:
  - Global: `<global-prompts>/{domain}-memory.instructions.md` → `<global-prompts>/{domain}.instructions.md`
  - Workspace: `<workspace-instructions>/{domain}-memory.instructions.md` → `<workspace-instructions>/{domain}.instructions.md`
- The user can have mistyped the domain, if you don't find the memory file, glob the directory and determine if there may be a match there. Ask the user for input if in doubt.
- **Read** both files (memory file must exist; instruction file may not)

### 2. Analyze and Propose

Review all memory sections and present them for merger consideration:

```
## Proposed Memories for Merger

### Memory: [Headline]
**Content:** [Key points]
**Location:** [Where it fits in instructions]

[More memories]...
```

Say: "Please review these memories. Approve all with 'go' or specify which to skip."

**STOP and wait for user input.**

### 3. Define Quality Bar

Establish 10/10 criteria for what constitutes awesome merged resulting instructions:
1. **Zero knowledge loss** - Every detail, example, and nuance preserved
2. **Minimal redundancy** - Overlapping guidance consolidated
3. **Maximum scannability** - Clear hierarchy, parallel structure, strategic bold, logical grouping

### 4. Merge and Iterate

Develop the final merged instructions **without updating files yet**:

1. Draft the merged instructions incorporating approved memories
2. Evaluate against quality bar
3. Refine structure, wording, organization
4. Repeat until the merged instructions meet 10/10 criteria

### 5. Update Files

Once the final merged instructions meet 10/10 criteria:

- **Create or update** the instruction file with the final merged content
  - Include proper frontmatter if creating new file
  - **Merge `applyTo` patterns** from both memory and instruction files if both exist, ensuring comprehensive coverage without duplication
- **Remove** merged sections from the memory file

## Example

```
User: "/memory-merger >clojure"

Agent:
1. Reads clojure-memory.instructions.md and clojure.instructions.md
2. Proposes 3 memories for merger
3. [STOPS]

User: "go"

Agent:
4. Defines quality bar for 10/10
5. Merges new instructions candidate, iterates to 10/10
6. Updates clojure.instructions.md
7. Cleans clojure-memory.instructions.md
```
